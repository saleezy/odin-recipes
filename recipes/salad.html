    If you grew up with ambrosia salads at your potlucks and holiday dinners,
    you most likely have your family's staple recipe in mind. But, if you're looking 
    to celebrate spring with a throwback Southern dessert this year, we think our 
    classic recipe really takes the cake. This Southern fruit salad is a classic 
    for very good reason: Full of fruits, nuts and coconut all tossed in a sweet 
    and creamy combo, it's our ideal kind of salad.
